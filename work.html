          For this project I built a simple pokemon app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As this was my first JavaScript
          project, I kept it very simple. The app loads pokémon
          data from an external API and enables the viewing of pokémon details
          by opening a modal on click.

        <h2>myFlix API</h2>
        <p>
          movie-api is the server-side component of a movies application the client-side of which was built later on
          with React, as well as Angular.
          This project is the only backend project I have built so far; working on it included building a REST API with
          Node.js and Express, as well as a database.
          For me, the biggest challenges were to determine all the endpoints for a complete REST API and implementing
          the authentication logic.
          Seeing the data be put to good use in my later myFlix client projects turned out to be very satisfying.

          The client-side of the myFlix application built with React. The app
          provides users with access to information about different movies,
          directors, as well as genres. Users can sign up for an account,
          update their user information, and create a list of their favorite
          movies.

          The objective was to build a serverless, progressive web application
          with React using a test-driven development technique. The application uses the
          Google Calendar API and AWS Lambda to fetch upcoming web development
          events. Users can search for a city and get a list of events hosted
          in that city.
          During the testing process I converted the key features of the app into user stories, then used the
          “Given-When-Then” syntax to define a full list of scenarios. You can view the list here: <br />

          As a developer I faced the challenge of building my first native mobile app. I did so with the help of React
          Native, Expo, and the Google
          Firestore Database. The app is accessible for iOS and
          Android users and provides them with a chat interface where they can
          exchange messages, and share images with their friends and family,
          as well as their location.

          This project was all about building another client-side for my myFlix movies application, using Angular
          instead of
          React this time. I used this opportunity to learn about a new framework and to really understand the
          differences between React and Angular. <br />
          This project also included creating a Kanban board with all the tasks
          required to build the app.
          Every task was assigned a certain amount of story points and moved to a “In Progress” column after starting to
          work on it, before finally being moved to a “Done” column: <br />
